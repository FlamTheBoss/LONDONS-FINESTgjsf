<h3>About us</h3>
<p>
    Londons Finest is a roblox group founded by the 2 owners, sharks and ramster. Arround one year ago development started and
     there main idea was to make a big roblox clothing group. They started to grow litle by litle to the point where they had a bigger and better idea, making a roblox game, a game about donations, interactions and entertaiment.
      And to this day theyre developping another game we still dont know much about.</p>
